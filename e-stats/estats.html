        Why did E-commerce prosper more in the pandemic than regular shopping
      </h1>
      <p class="p">
        Since the dawn of this pandemic,e-commerce played an immensily
        significant role in people's life. Since they couldn't reach out to the
        regular stores for supplies,e-commerce platforms such as Amazon were the
        only way to get resources such as groceries
      </p>

    <div class="slide2">
      <h1 class="h1">
        Why people hesitated in the beginning to buys things from e-commerce
        platforms
      </h1>
      <p class="p">
        This was so because of the fact that when the pandemic wasn't in
        existence, the quality of the products were much poorer and the prices
        were too high for the products, But as of now there is no choice but to
        trust and buy goods from the e-commerce platforms
      </p>

    <div class="slide3">
      <h1 class="h1">
        How did E-commerce help in stabalizing the downfall of global economy
      </h1>
      <p class="p">
        After the pandemic started started the Global economy was at its
        downfall, the market started going down at an alarming rate most people
        accepted that after the pandemic the economy will drop to a rate that
        was never considered even to be imagined. But with people using
        e-commerce platforms the rate of the global market is stabalizing and
        hopefully would get to its average point.
      </p>

    <div class="slide4">
      <h1 class="h1">
        Will E-commerce platforms takeover the market industry after the
        pandemic ends?
      </h1>
      <p class="p">
        Yes and no. People have started to realize that ordering things online
        is a lot convinient since you just have to press a few buttons and done,
        as simple as that. It will influence a lot of people to switch from
        regular shopping to online shopping. But there a few downfalls which may
        restrict people to use e-commerce platforms as their core source of
        items. online shopping takes a lot of time shipping whereas regular
        shopping is way more effective in terms of time comsumption. There more
        drawbacks like quality, difference in prices etc.

          <h1>Amazon's technology to let shoppers pay with a 'palm-scan'</h1>
          <p>Amazon.com Inc said it is rolling out biometric technology at its Whole Foods stores around Seattle starting on Wednesday, letting shoppers pay for items with a scan of their palm.
  
            The move shows how Amazon is bringing some of the technology already in use at its namesake brick-and-mortar Go and Books stores to the grocery chain it acquired in 2017.
            
            The system, called Amazon One, lets customers associate a credit card with their palm print. It offers a contact-less alternative to cash and card payments, Amazon said.

          <h1>Amazon says it registered 5 million merchants on its payments platform</h1>
          <p style="font-size: 1.2rem;"> Amazon on Saturday said it has registered 5 million merchants through Amazon Pay - its payments unit - and that it remains focussed on helping more small and medium businesses (SMBs) in the country to embrace digital payments. These merchants, many of whom earlier transacted only in cash, are now accepting payments from their customers using Amazon Pay's QR Code.

            "Since 2019, we have registered 5 million merchants through Amazon Pay and gotten 40 million customers through our service to use UPI. We're obviously not alone and the more companies like Amazon, and our competitors all help, the flywheel spins faster," Amazon Senior Vice President Russell Grandinetti said during the Amazon Smbhav event.
            
            He added organisations and governments across the world are not only inspired by Aadhaar, the India Stack and UPI but they are also looking at emulating these models.
